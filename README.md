# Eviction Lab Map Tool

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EvictionLab/eviction-maps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EvictionLab/eviction-maps)

Data visualization tool for [the Eviction Lab at Princeton University](https://evictionlab.org) displaying information on evictions and demographics for the United States.

## Setup

This project uses [Angular](https://angular.io/), and can be installed by cloning a local copy of the repo and running `npm install`. Use the Angular CLI to run a local development server with `ng serve` and access the site in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Deployment

The app is deployed as a static site served over AWS S3 and CloudFront. Mapbox vector tiles provide all of the source data, and are built using the pipeline in [EvictionLab/eviction-lab-etl](https://github.com/EvictionLab/eviction-lab-etl). Exports are generated using serverless AWS Lambda functions in [EvictionLab/eviction-lab-exports](https://github.com/EvictionLab/eviction-lab-exports), with map screenshots for the PowerPoint export being generated by an auto-scaling ECS microservice [EvictionLab/map-screenshot-gl](https://github.com/EvictionLab/map-screenshot-gl).
